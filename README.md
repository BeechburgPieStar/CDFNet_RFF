<img width="906" height="234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f4f8c7f-0a6e-47ce-9600-d94d9d3ffebc" />

## Overview
This repository provides a research-oriented implementation framework for **cross-domain radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF)** under receiver and channel variations.

The codebase includes:
- Baseline PatchNet models using raw or channel-equalized IQ signals
- Experimental scripts following standard cross-receiver and cross-channel evaluation protocols

The proposed **Confidence-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (CDFNet)** is part of an ongoing research work and is **not yet released**.

---

## Evaluation Protocol (Brief)

### Receiver Groups
Receivers are divided into four groups (R1–R4).  
A four-fold cross-validation protocol is adopted, where one group is used for testing and the remaining groups for training.

- **R1**: --test_round 0
- **R2**: --test_round 1
- **R3**: --test_round 2
- **RE**: --test_round 3
  
### Cross-Channel Settings
Three training configurations are considered:
- **Exp1**: train on one day (--train_date 1)
- **Exp2**: train on two days (--train_date 1 2)
- **Exp3**: train on three days (--train_date 1 2 3)

Performance is reported for each receiver group, and **Avg.** denotes the mean accuracy over R1–R4.

## Proposed Method and How to Run

### PatchNet (raw)
A single-branch PatchNet model using only raw IQ signals.

```
python main.py --train_date 1 2 3 --test_round 0
```

### PatchNet (eq)
A single-branch PatchNet model using only channel-equalized IQ signals.

```
python main.py --train_date 1 2 3 --test_round 0 --use_eq
```

These baselines are provided to analyze the respective roles of raw and equalized signal representations in cross-domain RFF.

### CDFNet (raw + eq)
The CDFNet implementation will be released after the associated paper is accepted.
